# AWS Credential Manager Extension

This browser extension helps Poridhi.io lab users automatically manage their AWS credentials when working with AWS Console.

## What this does

When you're taking Poridhi labs, you get temporary AWS credentials (Access Key, Secret Key, Session Token). Instead of manually copying and pasting these credentials every time, this extension:

- Stores your Poridhi lab credentials securely
- Automatically fills them in the AWS Console login
- Saves you time during labs
- Manages multiple lab sessions
